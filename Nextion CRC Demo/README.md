# CRC Demo Files for Nextion/TJC

## Description

These files demonstrate an interesting side effect of how Nextion Upload Protocol v1.2 works. 

There are 4 files, two that can be openend with the Nextion Editor, and two for people using TJCs USART HMI editor.

## Usage

Open the two files (f.ex. CRC-Demo-Dark-Nextion.HMI and CRC-Demo-Light-Nextion.HMI), select your target device, and upload one, then the other one of them to your device using the upload function of the editor. 

For sure won't be what you expect!
