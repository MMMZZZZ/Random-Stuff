# Draggable Round Slider

An example Nextion TFT file that demonstrates a round slider which can be dragged continuously. There are no steps and you get true 300 degrees of resolution. Compiled for NX4832F035_011 using Nextion Editor v1.63.3.

However, if you require such things, then **Nextion is not the right platform** for you. I will not support their position

> If you canâ€™t find a suitable control in the Nextion Editor, _simply_ build it yourself. *([Source](https://nextion.tech/2022/04/18/the-sunday-blog-circular-controls-part-2/))*

because it never is that _simple_ and IMO goes against the principles/philosophy of Nextion (or "intelligent" HMI screens in general) as I've already explained [here](https://unofficialnextion.com/t/touch-dragable-ring-slider/1471/2?u=max).

For these reasons **I will not share the source nor allow any derivatives** of this project. It's just a demo that it's possible. If you really want to stick with Nextion _and_ code your own widgets then you shall go through the full experience yourself. Maybe it helps you understand my statement above.
