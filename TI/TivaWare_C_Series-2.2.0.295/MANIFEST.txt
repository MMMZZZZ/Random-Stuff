Manifest for Texas Instruments TivaWare Clickwrap License Agreement

TivaWare version 2.2.0.295

Legend (explanation of the fields in the Manifest table below)

Software Name: The name of the application or file

Version: Version of the application or file

License Type: Type of license(s) under which TI will be providing software to 
the licensee (e.g. BSD, GPLv2, TI TSPA License, TI Commercial License). See 
Open Source Reference License Disclaimer in the Disclaimers Section. Whenever 
possible, TI will use an SPDX Short Identifier for an Open Source License. TI 
Commercial license terms are not usually included in the manifest and are 
conveyed through a variety of means such as a clickwrap license upon install, a 
signed license agreement and so forth.

Location: The directory name and path on the media (or in an archive) where the 
Software is located. Typically fully qualified path names are not used and 
instead the relevant top level directory of the application is given. A 
notation often used in the manifests is [as installed]/directory/*. Note that 
the asterisk implies that all files under that directory are licensed as the 
License Type field denotes. Any exceptions to this will generally be denoted as 
[as installed]/directory/* except as noted below which means as shown in 
subsequent rows of the manifest.

Delivered As: This field will either be "Source", "Binary" or "Source and 
Binary" and is the primary form the content of the Software is delivered in. If 
the Software is delivered in an archive format, this field applies to the 
contents of the archive. If the word Limited is used with Source, as in 
"Limited Source" or "Limited Source and Binary" then only portions of the 
Source for the application are provided.

Modified by TI: This field will either be "Yes" or "No". A "Yes" means TI has 
made changes to the Software. A "No" means TI has not made any changes. Note: 
This field is not applicable for Software "Obtained from" TI.

Obtained from: This field specifies from where or from whom TI obtained the 
Software. It may be a URL to an Open Source site, a 3rd party licensor, or TI.
