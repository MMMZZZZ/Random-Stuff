Hiberate Demo

This example demonstrates the use of the Hibernation module.  The module
will be configured for Real-Time Counter (RTC) mode using the 32.768kHz
crystal that is installed on the EK-TM4C1294XL LaunchPad.  With RTC mode, a
match time will be loaded to trigger an interrupt that will wake the device
from hibernation mode.

This example also uses a UART configured for 115200 baud, 8-N-1 mode to
send the current RTC count on each interrupt.
